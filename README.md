##### UI/UX Branding Assignment

###### The Background:

In Sweden, if you own an apartment that belongs to a housing association, the association will have a board composed of tenants. This board is responsible for making bigger decisions on behalf of the other tenants and communicating those decisions to the  housing cooperative (land owners).

When the tenants request repairs, construction work,  enhancements and other building management services, they will contact the board, which in turn will contact other companies to do the necessary work. 

Each tenant pays rent to the board, which is then responsible for managing the building and paying the housing cooperative (land owners). The housing cooperative is often a large company that owns many buildings, such as HSB.

###### The Scenario:

Birdie is a housing association with 40 tenants and 3 board members. HSB (housing cooperative) owns the physical land and building.

###### The Problem: 

- Birdies current processes are all manual!
  - For example
  - The current process for building updates is a physical notice board in the building hallway
  - Tenants have to use a notepad in the hallway to book the laundry room. 
  - There is no common way for the tenants, the board members and HSB to communicate back and forth with each other effectively. 
  - There is no process for tenants to find out what rights or benefits they have (e.g. access to guest rooms)

###### Solutions 
We propose a digital solution for Birdie that systematises communication processes within Birdie members (tenants), board members, and HSB thereby streamlining and enhancing the overall tenant experience.

1. Through the tenant app, tenants will be able to easily report problems and request services offered by Birdie. 

2. The main solution is the web app dashboard for the birdie board members and HSB. 

3. This platform will enable board members to connect with other building service providers (companies) i.e. to request quotations for construction work or other services.

4. Birdie board members will see in the web app dashboard any repair requests or any other kinds of requests from tenants.

5. The web app dashboard will allow board members to manage tenant requests and connections to other companies efficiently.

###### Task
Treat everything above as a business plan presented to you from the product owner.

### Note: You don't have to implement all of the solutions!. We would rather you focus on one or two of them and do them really well. The branding is the most important aspect for us. 

##### What is branding to us?

Branding refers to the process of creating a consistent and recognizable visual identity for a company or product across all touchpoints. This includes the design of the logo, colour scheme, typography, and overall aesthetic, as well as the tone and messaging used in all communications.

### Create a branding for the proposed solution. 

##### Branding
1. Create a name and explain why.
2. Choose appropriate colour pallets and fonts. 
4. Create a logo (keep it basic).
#### Design
5. Create user flows 
6. Create high fidelity wireframes for both tenant app and web app dashboard (skip authentication user flow, give us 4 to 6 wire frames in total not more)
7. Comment briefly on Accessibility considerations.
